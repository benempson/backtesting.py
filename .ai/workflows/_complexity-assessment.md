# COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT & ORCHESTRATOR PROTOCOL

This file is an **include** — it is referenced by other workflows, not invoked directly.

---

## A. SCORING MATRIX

Evaluate four dimensions. Each scores 0 or 1.

| Dimension | 0 (Simple) | 1 (Complex) | How to Measure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File Radius** | 1-3 source files touched | 4+ source files touched | Grep for symbols/modules affected; count distinct files |
| **Module Span** | Single module (e.g., only `_stats.py`) | 2+ modules in `backtesting/` | Check which modules are affected |
| **Independence** | All tasks are sequential (each depends on the previous) | 2+ tasks can execute in parallel (no shared files between them) | Analyze the plan checklist for dependency chains |
| **Research Load** | Existing patterns cover it; no exploration needed | Must read 5+ unfamiliar files or trace unknown call paths before planning | Count files needing investigation during gap analysis |

### Routing Rule

- **Score 0-1** -> **Inline Mode**. Proceed with the current workflow exactly as written. No sub-agents.
- **Score 2+** -> **Orchestrator Mode**. The current session becomes the orchestrator and delegates to sub-agents.

### Override Rules

- If the user explicitly says "keep it simple", "no agents", or "inline only" -> force **Inline Mode** regardless of score.
- If the user explicitly says "use sub-agents", "parallelize this", or "orchestrator mode" -> force **Orchestrator Mode** regardless of score.

## B. VISIBLE OUTPUT FORMAT

Before proceeding, emit this block so the user can see and override the routing decision:

```
COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT
  File Radius:    [0|1] — N files affected
  Module Span:    [0|1] — modules: [list]
  Independence:   [0|1] — N parallel groups identified
  Research Load:  [0|1] — N unfamiliar files to explore
  TOTAL:          N/4
  ROUTING:        [Inline Mode | Orchestrator Mode]
```

Wait for implicit or explicit user acknowledgment before proceeding. If the user objects to the routing, switch modes.

---

## C. ORCHESTRATOR PROTOCOL

When Orchestrator Mode is active, the current Claude Code session becomes the **Orchestrator**. The orchestrator coordinates work but **never writes implementation code directly**. All implementation is delegated to sub-agents.

### C.1 Sub-Agent Roles

| Role | `subagent_type` | Purpose | Can edit files? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | `Explore` | Read-only codebase exploration: trace call paths, find existing patterns, identify affected files, locate test fixtures | No |
| **Architect** | `Plan` | Analyze Scout findings; propose plan structure, dependency graph, and parallel groups | No |
| **Implementor** | `general-purpose` | Write tests + implementation code for a specific, scoped task group from the plan | Yes |

### C.2 Wave Execution Model

Work proceeds in sequential waves. Agents within a wave run in parallel.

```
[RESEARCH WAVE]  ->  [PLANNING WAVE]  ->  [EXECUTION WAVE(S)]  ->  [VERIFICATION]
```

**Research Wave:**
- Spawn 1-3 Scout agents in parallel, each with a distinct exploration focus (e.g., one per affected module, or one for existing patterns + one for test fixtures).
- Wait for ALL Scouts to complete before proceeding.
- If a Scout returns insufficient information, spawn ONE follow-up Scout (max 1 retry per question).

**Planning Wave (optional):**
- If the orchestrator can write the plan directly from Scout results, skip this wave.
- If the task is large (10+ plan items) or the dependency structure is unclear, spawn 1 Architect agent to propose the plan structure and parallel groups.
- The orchestrator transcribes the Architect's output into the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-*.md` file. The Architect does not write to the plan file.

**Execution Wave(s):**
- The orchestrator reads the plan and groups checklist items into **parallel groups** based on file ownership (see Section D).
- Each wave spawns 1-3 Implementor agents. Each Implementor receives:
  1. Its specific checklist items from the plan
  2. A file whitelist (files it may create or modify)
  3. The relevant architectural rules (see Section C.3)
  4. The test class/methods it should write to
- Waves run sequentially. Agents within a wave run in parallel.
- After each wave completes, the orchestrator marks completed items `[x]` in the plan file before spawning the next wave.

**Verification:**
- After ALL execution waves complete, the orchestrator runs `python -m backtesting.test` to verify the full suite.
- The orchestrator then performs the Adversarial Security Review (Rule 13) examining all files modified across all agents.

### C.3 Rule Injection (MANDATORY)

Sub-agents do not automatically load `.ai/rules/`. The orchestrator MUST inject the following into every **Implementor** agent's prompt:

1. **TDD mandate** — "Write the failing test BEFORE the implementation code. No exceptions. Follow the test-first protocol from Rule 08."
2. **Module separation** — "The dependency direction is: lib.py → backtesting.py → _util.py/_stats.py/_plotting.py. Internal modules do not import from backtesting.py or lib.py. Do not create imports that violate this direction."
3. **Production-ready** — "No TODO comments, no placeholder logic, no debug print() statements. Use warnings.warn() for user-facing messages only."
4. **Test framework** — "Tests use unittest.TestCase. Add tests to backtesting/test/_test.py. Run with `python -m backtesting.test`."
5. **API stability** — "Do not change public API signatures without explicit approval. Changes to exports from backtesting or backtesting.lib are breaking changes."

For **Scout** agents, inject only the module separation rule (so they understand what they're looking at).

### C.4 Orchestrator Status Reporting

The orchestrator emits a status block before and after each wave so the user maintains visibility:

```
WAVE 1/3: RESEARCH
  Spawning 2 Scout agents:
    Scout-1: Exploring backtesting/backtesting.py for order processing patterns
    Scout-2: Exploring backtesting/test/_test.py for existing test fixtures
  [waiting for results...]

  Scout-1: Complete. Found 3 relevant patterns in _Broker class.
  Scout-2: Complete. Identified TestBacktest class with 50+ test methods.
```

```
WAVE 2/3: EXECUTION
  Spawning 2 Implementor agents:
    Impl-1: Items 1-4 (core engine) — files: backtesting.py, _test.py
    Impl-2: Items 5-7 (statistics) — files: _stats.py, _test.py
  [waiting for results...]

  Impl-1: Complete. Updated _Broker class, wrote 4 tests.
  Impl-2: Complete. Updated compute_stats, wrote 3 tests.
```

## D. FILE OWNERSHIP MAP & PLAN HEADER

### Plan Header Requirements

All `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-*.md` files MUST include a `> Routing:` line in the header so that resume logic can detect the correct execution mode:

```
> Target Spec: docs/specs/[area]/[filename-spec.md]
> Routing: [Inline|Orchestrator] (Score N/4)
> Wave: 2 of 3                                      ← Orchestrator Mode only; updated after each wave
```

The `> Routing:` line is read by resume logic (Step 2 of implement-spec, Step 5 of update-spec) to determine whether to resume in Inline or Orchestrator mode. Without it, Orchestrator Mode work may incorrectly resume as Inline Mode after a session reset.

### File Ownership Map

Before each Execution Wave, the orchestrator MUST build a file ownership map and enforce these rules:

1. **List every file** each Implementor will create or modify.
2. **Check for overlaps.** If two Implementors need the same file, they CANNOT run in parallel. Move one to the next sequential wave.
3. **Record the map** in the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-*.md` under a `## Parallel Groups` section:

```markdown
## Parallel Groups

### Wave 1 (parallel)
- **Group A** (core engine): Items 1-4
  Files: backtesting/backtesting.py, backtesting/test/_test.py
- **Group B** (statistics): Items 5-7
  Files: backtesting/_stats.py

### Wave 2 (sequential — depends on Wave 1)
- **Group C** (lib helpers): Items 8-10
  Files: backtesting/lib.py, backtesting/test/_test.py
  Depends on: Group A (uses new core feature)
```

**Hard cap:** Maximum 3 parallel Implementor agents per wave. If more than 3 independent groups exist, queue them into sequential waves of 3.

---

## E. TDD BATCHING PROTOCOL

In Orchestrator Mode, the interactive TDD gates ("run test, confirm red") are batched for efficiency:

1. **Each Implementor writes the failing test FIRST, then the implementation code.** This is enforced in the Implementor's prompt (Section C.3). The Implementor does not ask the user to run tests — it writes both test and code.
2. **After ALL Implementors in a wave complete,** the orchestrator runs the test suite ONCE: `python -m backtesting.test`.
3. **If tests fail,** the orchestrator identifies which Implementor's work caused the failure and spawns a targeted fix agent for that group only.
4. **The TDD discipline is preserved** because test methods are always written before implementation code within each Implementor's execution. The batching only defers the interactive verification gate — it does not skip it.

---

## F. RESUMABILITY PROTOCOL

If the session is interrupted mid-wave (context limit, crash, user disconnect):

1. **On resume**, the orchestrator checks the current state:
   - Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-*.md` for unchecked `[ ]` items.
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see which files were actually modified since the plan was created.
   - Compare modified files against the `## Parallel Groups` file ownership map.
2. **Mark completed items**: If a group's files are all present and modified, mark its items `[x]`.
3. **Resume from next unchecked item** — spawn the next wave of Implementors for remaining groups.
4. **If partially modified** (some files in a group changed, others not), treat the group as incomplete. Spawn a single Implementor to finish the remaining items in that group.

---

## G. SECURITY REVIEW SCOPE

The Adversarial Security Review (Rule 13) remains an **orchestrator-level responsibility**. It is NEVER delegated to sub-agents because:
- Sub-agents see only their slice of the codebase.
- Security vulnerabilities often span multiple slices (e.g., an unvalidated input in one module consumed without checking in another).
- The review needs the full picture of ALL changes made across ALL agents in the session.

After all execution waves complete and tests pass, the orchestrator:
1. Collects the list of every file modified by any Implementor agent.
2. Reads each modified file.
3. Performs the Rule 13 adversarial review against the complete change set.

---

## H. MID-FLIGHT REASSESSMENT

During Inline Mode execution, the initial complexity assessment may become stale as the actual scope is revealed.

### Trigger

After completing **50% of plan items**, check:
- Count the number of distinct source files actually modified so far (via `git diff --name-only` or by tracking edits).
- Compare against the original **File Radius** estimate from the complexity assessment.

### Action

If the actual file count exceeds the original estimate by **2 or more files**:

1. **Pause** the execution loop.
2. **Emit** an updated complexity assessment:
   ```
   MID-FLIGHT REASSESSMENT
     Original File Radius: N files
     Actual files touched:  M files (+D over estimate)
     Remaining items:       K unchecked
     RECOMMENDATION:        [Continue Inline | Switch to Orchestrator]
   ```
3. **If switching is recommended** (remaining items span 2+ independent groups): Offer to switch to Orchestrator Mode. If the user accepts:
   - Update the plan file header: `> Routing: Orchestrator (upgraded mid-flight)`
   - Add a `## Parallel Groups` section for the remaining unchecked items.
   - Proceed to the Orchestrator execution loop (Step 3b / 6b in the parent workflow).
4. **If continuing Inline** is recommended (remaining items are sequential): Note the reassessment in the plan file and continue.

### Constraint

Do not reassess more than once per workflow execution. One check at the 50% mark is sufficient.
