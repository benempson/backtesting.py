# WORKFLOW: UPDATE SPECIFICATION

## 1. SELECT & REVIVE
- **Gate:** Ensure the user has defined the spec to update. If not, ask the user to define it, and exit.
- **Context Lock:** Read the target spec file. Follow the protocol in `.ai/workflows/_context-load.md` to load architectural context before the interrogation step.

## 2. DEFINE & INTERROGATE (ANTI-ASSUMPTION)
- **User Prompt:** *"What needs to change?"*
- **Gap Analysis (Rule 02):** Analyze the request. Are there ambiguities? Are there missing technical details required for a production-ready implementation?
- **Logic vs Config Scope Check:** Before expanding scope, ask: *"Is this change logic-only (new code path, new computation, behavior change) or config/docs only?"* Confirm explicitly with the user if both appear affected.
- **Unhappy Path Audit:** For every changed or new behavior, follow the 5-category checklist in `.ai/workflows/_unhappy-paths.md`. Do not accept "handle errors gracefully" as an answer — name each case.
- **Constraint:** **STOP and ASK** clarifying questions if anything is unclear. Do not proceed until requirements are sufficient for a complete, production-ready feature.

## 3. ASSIGN CHANGE ID
- **Purpose:** Each spec change receives a unique **change-id** so that multiple changes to the same spec can be developed concurrently without plan file collisions.
- **Format:** A short descriptive kebab-case slug (2-4 words) derived from the change description (e.g., `add-fractional-sizing`, `fix-nan-drawdown`, `add-trailing-stop`).
- **Constraint:** The slug must be unique among any active `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-*.md` files in the project root. If a collision is detected, append a numeric suffix.

## 4. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION (SPEC-FIRST)
- **Action:** Append a new section to the bottom of the spec file:
    ```markdown
    ## Revision [Date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — change-id: {change-id}
    ### Requirements
    - [ ] [The New Requirement — Happy Path]

    ### Unhappy Paths
    - **[Trigger condition]:** [Expected system response — raised exception, warning, fallback value]
    - *(List every identified failure mode. "N/A" only acceptable if the change has no data processing, computation, or I/O.)*

    ### Technical Plan
    - **Validation:** [Boundary checks if any]
    - **Test Strategy:** [Test class to update + key scenarios]
    ```

## 5. TACTICAL PLANNING (THE SCRATCHPAD)
- **Plan File:** Derive the plan filename: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-{change-id}.md`.
- **Collision Check:** Check if this plan file already exists.
- **Resume Logic:** If it exists and the header matches:
    - Check the `> Routing:` line. If it says `Orchestrator`, proceed to Step 6b (wave execution). If it says `Inline` or is absent, proceed to Step 6.
    - Find the first unchecked `[ ]` item and resume from there.
- **Cross-Plan Awareness:** Scan for other active `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-*.md` files. If any exist, warn about overlapping files.
- **Scope Check (MANDATORY for rename/replace changes):** If the change involves renaming a symbol, parameter, or import path, grep `backtesting/` for the old pattern before writing the plan. Include every matching file in the checklist.
- **Generation (If new):**
    - **Header (CRITICAL):** The first two lines MUST be:
      ```
      > Target Spec: docs/specs/[area]/[filename-spec].md
      > Change ID: {change-id}
      ```
    - **Atomic Decomposition:** Convert high-level spec steps into a detailed checklist.
    - **Mandatory Integration:** Add explicit tasks for **Validation** (Rule 06), **TDD** (Rule 08/09), and **Warnings** (where applicable).
    - **Mandatory Unhappy Path Tasks:** For every failure mode, generate a discrete checklist item covering both the logic (try/except block, fallback) and the warning/exception message.

## 5b. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT
- **Assessment:** Follow the scoring protocol in `.ai/workflows/_complexity-assessment.md` (Section A). Evaluate the four dimensions against the plan generated in Step 5.
- **Emit** the visible output block (Section B of `_complexity-assessment.md`).
- **Routing:**
    - **Score 0-1** -> **Inline Mode.** Proceed to Step 6 (current sequential execution loop).
    - **Score 2+** -> **Orchestrator Mode.** Proceed to Step 6b (orchestrated execution).
- **Persist Routing Decision:** Add a `> Routing: [Inline|Orchestrator] (Score N/4)` line to the plan file header. In Orchestrator Mode, also add `> Wave: 1 of N`.
- **Parallel Groups (Orchestrator Mode only):** Append a `## Parallel Groups` section to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-{change-id}.md` per Section D of `_complexity-assessment.md`.

## 6. EXECUTION LOOP — INLINE MODE (DRIVEN BY PLAN)
- **Applies when:** Complexity Score 0-1 (Inline Mode), or resuming a plan with `> Routing: Inline`.
- **Production-Ready Mandate:** No "TODO" comments or hardcoded placeholders allowed.
- **The Loop:** Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-{change-id}.md`. Find the first unchecked item `[ ]`.
- **Standard Task Protocol:**
    1. **Pre-Code Analysis:** Consult `09-testing-roi.md`. If Category A (Logic), enforce **TDD (Rule 08)**.
    2. **Implementation (Test):** Write failing test cases. Run them to confirm "Clean Red" failure.
    3. **Implementation (Code):** Write source code to pass tests. Ensure module dependency direction is respected.
    4. **Warnings:** Include `warnings.warn()` where appropriate for new user-facing messages.
    5. **Verification:**
        -   **IF CATEGORY A:** Run the specific test class: `python -m unittest backtesting.test._test.TestClassName -v`
        -   **IF CATEGORY B:** Verify the change has the expected effect.
- **Update:** Once verified, mark `[x]` in both `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-{change-id}.md` and the **Target Spec** file.
- **Mid-Flight Reassessment:** After completing 50% of plan items, if the number of files touched exceeds the original File Radius estimate by 2+, pause and re-assess per `.ai/workflows/_complexity-assessment.md` Section H. Offer to switch to Orchestrator Mode for remaining items.

## 6b. EXECUTION LOOP — ORCHESTRATOR MODE (WAVE-BASED)
- **Applies when:** Complexity Score 2+ (Orchestrator Mode).
- **Protocol:** Follow the Wave Execution Model from `.ai/workflows/_complexity-assessment.md` Section C.2.
- **Research Wave:** Spawn 1-3 Scout agents in parallel to explore each affected module. Wait for all to complete.
- **Planning Wave (optional):** If 10+ plan items with unclear dependencies, spawn 1 Architect agent to refine parallel groups.
- **Execution Wave(s):**
    1. Read the `## Parallel Groups` section. Identify the first wave of independent groups.
    2. Spawn 1-3 Implementor agents per wave, each with scoped checklist items, file whitelist, and mandatory rule injections (Section C.3).
    3. Wait for wave completion. Mark items `[x]`.
    4. Repeat for subsequent waves.
- **Emit wave status** per Section C.4.
- **After all waves complete:** Proceed to Step 7 (Completion & Security).

## 7. COMPLETION & SECURITY
- **Regression Check:** Run `python -m backtesting.test`. Do not proceed until green.

## 8. ADVERSARIAL SECURITY REVIEW (RULE 13)
> Follow the protocol in `.ai/workflows/_security-review.md`.

## 9. GOVERNANCE & PLAN REMOVAL
- **Remove:** Delete `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-{spec-stem}-{change-id}.md`.
- **Update Operational Reference** (`docs/refs/[area]/[current-filename]-ref.md`, if it exists):
    1. Read the current ref in full before making changes.
    2. Check each section against what changed in this update cycle:
        - **Constants** — Did any module-level constants or default parameter values change?
        - **Function Signatures** — Did any public function signatures change?
        - **Edge Cases** — Does the revision's root-cause analysis belong here?
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Decision:** Determine whether this update warrants a `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` refresh (triggers: new module in `backtesting/`, new major feature, modified `AGENTS.md`). If yes, execute the `document-project` workflow.
