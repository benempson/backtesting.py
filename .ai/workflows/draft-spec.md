# Draft New Specification

1.  **Ingest & Interrogate:**
    -   Ask the user: *"What feature or complex fix are we planning?"*
    -   **Gap Analysis:** Analyze the user's response. Is it detailed enough to build?
    -   **Action:** If the request is high-level (e.g., "Add fractional sizing support"), you MUST ask clarifying questions *before* proposing a plan.
        -   *Example:* "How should fractional sizes interact with the existing commission model? What about margin calculations?"
    -   **Unhappy Path Probe:** Follow the 5-category checklist in `.ai/workflows/_unhappy-paths.md`. Do not move to Step 2 until every applicable category has a defined fallback behavior.

2.  **Architectural & Rules Review:**
    -   Read `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`.
    -   Analyze the user's intent against the architectural rules (module dependency direction, API stability, etc.).

2b. **Solution Research (Orchestrated):**
    -   **Purpose:** Before drafting, research how to solve the problem. This phase always runs — the depth scales with complexity, not a binary gate.
    -   **Research Depth Decision:** Assess the feature scope from Steps 1-2:
        -   **Shallow** (well-understood pattern, single module, <3 files): The orchestrator performs the research inline — read the relevant source files, check existing patterns, and proceed to Step 3. No sub-agents needed.
        -   **Standard** (new computation, unfamiliar area, or 2+ modules): Spawn research agents in parallel (see below).
        -   **Deep** (novel capability, no existing pattern to follow, external library evaluation, or user explicitly requests thorough research): Spawn research agents with broader scope including web searches and documentation lookups.
    -   **Emit** the research depth decision:
        ```
        RESEARCH DEPTH: [Shallow | Standard | Deep]
        Rationale: [1-2 sentence justification]
        ```
    -   **Standard/Deep Research Wave:**
        1.  **Codebase Scouts** — Spawn 1-3 agents (subagent_type: `Explore`) in parallel, one per affected module area. Each identifies:
            -   Existing patterns and interfaces in its area
            -   Constraints and invariants that the new feature must respect
            -   Potential failure modes specific to that area
            -   Test patterns already in use
        2.  **Solution Researchers** (Deep only) — Spawn 1-2 agents (subagent_type: `general-purpose`) in parallel to research approaches:
            -   How do the relevant libraries (numpy, pandas, bokeh) support this feature? Search documentation, read source code, check for known limitations.
            -   Are there established patterns or community solutions for this type of problem?
            -   What are the trade-offs between candidate approaches?
            -   Each researcher returns a structured brief: **Approach**, **Pros**, **Cons**, **Risks**, **Recommended**.
        3.  **Wait** for all agents to complete.
        4.  **Synthesis:** The orchestrator aggregates all findings into a **Research Summary** containing:
            -   **Existing Patterns:** What the codebase already does that's relevant
            -   **Candidate Approaches:** 2-3 viable solutions with trade-offs
            -   **Recommended Approach:** The orchestrator's recommendation with rationale
            -   **Constraints Discovered:** Hard limits from the codebase (module dependency direction, API stability, numeric precision, etc.)
            -   **Open Questions:** Anything the research couldn't resolve — these become questions for the user in Step 3
        5.  **Persist:** Write the Research Summary as a `## Research Summary` section in the spec file (before `## Requirements`). This ensures the research survives session resets and is available to `/implement-spec` later.
        6.  **Present** the Research Summary to the user before proceeding to Step 3.
    -   **User Override:** If the user says "skip research" or "I already know how to do this", proceed directly to Step 3.

3.  **Drafting (Iterative):**
    -   Propose a **Requirements List** and **Technical Plan** based on `docs/specs/templates/feature-spec.md` (if it exists). Use the Research Summary from Step 2b as the draft foundation — the recommended approach becomes the default technical plan, and discovered constraints become architectural guardrails in the spec.
    -   **Constraint (Unhappy Paths — MANDATORY):** For every happy-path requirement, you MUST enumerate its corresponding failure modes in the spec. Each failure mode must specify: the trigger condition, the expected system response, and whether it requires a raised exception or a warning. Do not write "handle errors gracefully" — name the specific case.
    -   **Constraint (Testing):** You MUST identify the target test class and the key test scenarios. Don't just say "we will test it"; say "we need a test that creates a Backtest with empty data and verifies ValueError is raised."
    -   **Approval Gate:** If the Research Summary contains **Open Questions**, ask: *"The research identified these open questions: [list]. Are there also missing requirements, unhandled failure modes, or architectural risks?"* If there are no open questions and the plan is complete, emit: *"Research complete — no gaps found. Here is the structured plan."* and proceed. The user can still interject with changes.
    -   **Refine:** If the user adds details, update the plan.

4.  **File Generation:**
    -   Once approved, generate the file in `docs/specs/[area]/[feature-name]-spec.md`, where `[area]` mirrors the implementation module (e.g., `core`, `lib`, `stats`, `plotting`).
    -   **Constraint (Failure Modes section — MANDATORY):** The generated spec file MUST contain a `## Failure Modes` section placed before the Implementation Checklist. A spec without this section is incomplete and MUST NOT be saved.
    -   **Action:** Save the file.

5.  **Next Steps:**
    -   Ask the user: *"Spec saved to `docs/specs/[area]/[name]-spec.md`. Ready to implement now? I can start `/implement-spec` immediately, or you can run it later."*
    -   If the user confirms, invoke `/implement-spec` with the spec path.
